Rangy-bower
===========

bower package for rather wonderful [rangy](https://code.google.com/p/rangy/) library.


>A cross-browser JavaScript range and selection library. It provides a simple standards-based API for performing common DOM Range and Selection tasks in all major browsers, abstracting away the wildly different implementations of this functionality between Internet Explorer up to and including version 8 and DOM-compliant browsers.
